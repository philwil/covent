First Ideas

Need to control a servo motor to provide a pressure release cycle.
Motor Speed and range of motion needs to be controlled.
The code to run the Pololu V5C controller with ROS  is already to go. So its a good start.
The motor controoler takes care of managing the encoder, limit switches , current , speed profile etc. 

A simple unit may have a LCD display and a few control switches. Hence the need for GPIO , ADC, LCD modules.

The initial unit could be powered by a 12 v sealed battery with other options being developed.

The servo motor will have limit switches, an encoder and, possibly, an absolute position feedback.
Dont know the requirements for teh servo motor yet.

Using a PI provides a good base OS with wireless networks etc.
